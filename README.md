# Login Function
This is my final project for my education at Chas Academy "UX/UI designer with frontend skills." The project was created in collaboration with a large energy company in Sweden. My focus was to create an accessible login function with BankID.

## Limitations
I'm not allowed to display the company's design or name. Therefore, my plan is to change the design to better reflect my interests.

The BankID is a design login that demonstrates how an accessible BankID could look. Accessibility was my primary focus, and styling took a back seat. This project was primarily a UX design project with a report, and the code was secondary.

## Challenges
Designing a login function with BankID meant taking many factors into account. Security was a major consideration, along with the company's requirements. As mentioned earlier, creating an accessible login for something inherently inaccessible, like a QR code, was another significant challenge.

## How I Solved It
The solution is a compromise of all important aspects, with accessibility being the top priority.

## Wish List
- Create a more complete login function based on a different type of company, allowing for a more comprehensive design.

## If I Could Start All Over Again
If I started this project again, I would focus more on the code and accessibility, rather than primarily on the design.
